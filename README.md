# Everything Claude Code

**The complete collection of Claude Code configs from an Anthropic hackathon winner.**

This repo contains production-ready agents, skills, hooks, commands, rules, and MCP configurations that I use daily with Claude Code. These configs evolved over 10+ months of intensive use building real products.

## Read the Full Guide First

**Before diving into these configs, read the complete guide on X:**

**[The Shorthand Guide to Everything Claude Code](https://x.com/affaanmustafa/status/2012378465664745795)**



The guide explains:
- What each config type does and when to use it
- How to structure your Claude Code setup
- Context window management (critical for performance)
- Parallel workflows and advanced techniques
- The philosophy behind these configs

**This repo is configs only! Tips, tricks and more examples are in my X articles and videos (links will be appended to this readme as it evolves).**

## Quick Start

### 1. Copy what you need

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code.git

# Copy agents to your Claude config
cp everything-claude-code/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Copy rules
cp everything-claude-code/rules/*.md ~/.claude/rules/

# Copy commands
cp everything-claude-code/commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/

# Copy skills
cp -r everything-claude-code/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

### 2. Add hooks to settings.json

Copy the hooks from `hooks/hooks.json` to your `~/.claude/settings.json`.

### 3. Configure MCPs

Copy desired MCP servers from `mcp-configs/mcp-servers.json` to your `~/.claude.json`.

**Important:** Replace `YOUR_*_HERE` placeholders with your actual API keys.

### 4. Read the guide

Seriously, [read the guide](https://x.com/affaanmustafa/status/2012378465664745795). These configs make 10x more sense with context.

## Key Concepts

### Agents

Subagents handle delegated tasks with limited scope. Example:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: opus
---

You are a senior code reviewer...
```

### Skills

Skills are workflow definitions invoked by commands or agents:

```markdown
# TDD Workflow

1. Define interfaces first
2. Write failing tests (RED)
3. Implement minimal code (GREEN)
4. Refactor (IMPROVE)
5. Verify 80%+ coverage
```

### Hooks

Hooks fire on tool events. Example - warn about console.log:

```json
{
  "matcher": "tool == \"Edit\" && tool_input.file_path matches \"\\\\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$\"",
  "hooks": [{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "#!/bin/bash\ngrep -n 'console\\.log' \"$file_path\" && echo '[Hook] Remove console.log' >&2"
  }]
}
```

### Rules

Rules are always-follow guidelines. Keep them modular:

```
~/.claude/rules/
  security.md      # No hardcoded secrets
  coding-style.md  # Immutability, file limits
  testing.md       # TDD, coverage requirements
```

## Contributing

**Contributions are welcome and encouraged.**

This repo is meant to be a community resource. If you have:
- Useful agents or skills
- Clever hooks
- Better MCP configurations
- Improved rules

Please contribute! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

### Ideas for Contributions

- Language-specific skills (Python, Go, Rust patterns)
- Framework-specific configs (Django, Rails, Laravel)
- DevOps agents (Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS)
- Testing strategies (different frameworks)
- Domain-specific knowledge (ML, data engineering, mobile)

## Background

I've been using Claude Code since the experimental rollout. Won the Anthropic x Forum Ventures hackathon in Sep 2025 building [zenith.chat](https://zenith.chat) with [@DRodriguezFX](https://x.com/DRodriguezFX) - entirely using Claude Code.

These configs are battle-tested across multiple production applications.

---

## Important Notes

### Context Window Management

**Critical:** Don't enable all MCPs at once. Your 200k context window can shrink to 70k with too many tools enabled.

Rule of thumb:
- Have 20-30 MCPs configured
- Keep under 10 enabled per project
- Under 80 tools active

Use `disabledMcpServers` in project config to disable unused ones.

### Customization

These configs work for my workflow. You should:
1. Start with what resonates
2. Modify for your stack
3. Remove what you don't use
4. Add your own patterns
